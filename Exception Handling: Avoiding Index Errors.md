# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

##   Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

##   Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

##   Program
```
lst=[5, 10, 20]
try:
    print(lst[5])
except:
    print("You're out of list range")
```
## Output
<img width="837" height="215" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad710bf9-c9a8-4a3b-bea5-0d2e825c7908" />

## Result
Thus the program that handles an IndexError when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list has been executed successfully.
